## How the System Works

1. Voltage and current are sensed using ZMPT101B and ACS712/SCT sensors.
2. ESP32 reads the analog values using ADC pins.
3. Power is calculated using the formula: `Power = Voltage Ã— Current`.
4. Data is pushed to Blynk Cloud using virtual pins.
5. Users monitor the data on the Blynk mobile dashboard.

## Blynk Integration

- Setup a Blynk IoT project and obtain the Auth Token.
- Use the following virtual pins:

| Parameter      | Virtual Pin |
|----------------|-------------|
| Voltage 1      | V0          |
| Voltage 2      | V1          |
| Current 1      | V2          |
| Current 2      | V3          |
| Power 1        | V4          |
| Power 2        | V5          |

Example code snippet:
```cpp
Blynk.virtualWrite(V0, voltage1);
Blynk.virtualWrite(V1, voltage2);
Blynk.virtualWrite(V2, current1);
Blynk.virtualWrite(V3, current2);
Blynk.virtualWrite(V4, power1);
Blynk.virtualWrite(V5, power2);
```

## Running the Project

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `with lcd.txt` or `without cloud and lcd.txt` in the Arduino IDE.
3. Replace the Wi-Fi SSID, password, and Blynk Auth Token.
4. Upload the code to the ESP32 board.
5. Open the Blynk mobile app and start monitoring.
